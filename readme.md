Crypt
=====

This is a small helper for decryption project. It's also my first python script so any comment on the
way of using python is welcome.

Using it
--------

To use it, simply go to the base dire and type ``python src/watcher.py`` to run the watcher. Any change in 
one of the ``*.py`` file will trigger the generation.

This has been tested with the 3.3 version of python on a windows 7 laptop.

This is currently not intended to decrypt multiple messages but only the one in the input file. In the future it 
might also crypt messages.
